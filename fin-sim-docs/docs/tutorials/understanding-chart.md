# Understanding the Chart

The interactive chart is the heart of FinSim Pro. It visualizes your projected balance over time based on your defined events.

## Features

### Zoom and Pan
*   **Zoom:** Use the `+` / `-` buttons in the header, or scroll with your mouse wheel while holding `Ctrl/Cmd`.
*   **Pan:** Click and drag the chart to move through time.

### Granularity
Switch between **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, **Quarterly**, and **Yearly** views using the buttons in the top-left.

### Simulation Range
The green dashed lines indicate the **Simulation Start** and **End** dates. Events outside this range are not calculated.
