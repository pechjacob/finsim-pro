# Your First Simulation

In this tutorial, we will build a simple financial simulation to model a savings goal.

## Goal
We want to see if we can save **$10,000** in one year.

## Prerequisites
*   FinSim Pro installed and running.
*   A default "Checking" account (or create a new one).

## Steps

### 1. Set Initial Balance
1.  Click on the "Checking" account in the sidebar.
2.  Set the **Initial Balance** to `$1,000` (your current savings).

### 2. Add Monthly Income
1.  Click **+ Add Income**.
2.  **Name:** "Job".
3.  **Amount:** `$3,000`.
4.  **Frequency:** "Monthly".
5.  **Start Date:** Today.
6.  Click **Save**.

### 3. Add Monthly Expenses
1.  Click **+ Add Expense**.
2.  **Name:** "Rent & Bills".
3.  **Amount:** `$2,000`.
4.  **Frequency:** "Monthly".
5.  Click **Save**.

### 4. Add a One-Time Expense
Let's say you plan to buy a laptop in 6 months.
1.  Click **+ Add Expense**.
2.  **Name:** "Laptop".
3.  **Amount:** `$1,500`.
4.  **Frequency:** "One-time".
5.  **Date:** Select a date 6 months from now.
6.  Click **Save**.

## Analyze the Result
Look at the chart.
*   Hover over the date exactly one year from now.
*   What is the balance?

**Calculation:**
*   Starting: $1,000
*   Net Monthly: $3,000 - $2,000 = $1,000
*   12 Months: $1,000 * 12 = $12,000
*   Laptop: -$1,500
*   **Total:** $1,000 + $12,000 - $1,500 = **$11,500**

🎉 **Success!** You reached your goal of $10,000.
