# Financial Chart

The **Financial Chart** is the central visualization tool in FinSim Pro. It displays your projected account balance over time, allowing you to spot trends, deficits, and growth opportunities.

## Key Controls

### Zoom and Pan
*   **Zoom In/Out:** Use the `+` and `-` buttons in the chart header.
*   **Mouse Wheel Zoom:** Hold `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on Mac) and scroll with your mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
*   **Pan:** Click and drag anywhere on the chart area to move back and forth in time.

### Time Granularity
Switch between different views to analyze your finances at different scales:
*   **Daily:** View day-by-day balance changes.
*   **Weekly:** Good for short-term planning.
*   **Monthly:** Ideal for budgeting and bill tracking.
*   **Quarterly:** Spot seasonal trends.
*   **Yearly:** Long-term wealth projection.

### Simulation Range
The chart displays two vertical green dashed lines:
1.  **Simulation Start:** The current date (or your custom start date).
2.  **Simulation End:** The end of the projection period (default is 5 years).

Events outside this range are not calculated or displayed.

## Crosshair & Tooltip
Hover over any point on the chart to see:
*   **Date:** The specific date under your cursor.
*   **Balance:** The exact projected balance for that date.
