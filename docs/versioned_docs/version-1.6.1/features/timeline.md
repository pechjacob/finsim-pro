# Event Timeline

The **Event Timeline** allows you to manage all your financial events—Income, Expenses, and Transfers. It provides a chronological view of what's affecting your balance.

## Managing Events

### Adding an Event
Click the **+ Add Income** or **+ Add Expense** buttons in the sidebar to create a new event.

### Editing an Event
Click on any event bar in the timeline to open the editor in the sidebar. You can change:
*   Name
*   Amount
*   Frequency
*   Start/End Dates

### Drag-and-Drop
You can drag events directly on the timeline to reschedule them.
*   **Move:** Drag the center of the bar to move the entire event.
*   **Resize:** Drag the edges of the bar to change the Start or End date.

## Zoom Tracking
The timeline includes a **Zoom Tracking** toggle in the header (next to the Flip icon).
*   **Enabled (Purple):** The timeline view syncs with the Chart's zoom level.
*   **Disabled (Green):** The timeline shows the full simulation range, regardless of the chart's zoom.

## Filtering
Use the **Filter** button to show only specific types of events:
*   **All Events**
*   **Income Only**
*   **Expenses Only**
*   **Variable (Formulas)**
