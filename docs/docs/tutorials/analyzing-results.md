# Analyzing Results

Once you've set up your simulation, it's time to analyze the data to make better financial decisions.

## Reading the Chart

### The Trend Line
*   **Upward Slope:** Your wealth is growing. You are saving more than you spend.
*   **Downward Slope:** You are burning cash. Your expenses exceed your income.
*   **Flat Line:** You are breaking even.

### Critical Points
Look for dips in the chart.
*   **Below Zero:** If the line crosses below $0, you will run out of money.
*   **Recovery:** How long does it take to recover from a large expense?

## Using the Timeline

### "What If" Scenarios
The timeline is interactive. You can toggle events on and off to see their impact.
*   *Scenario:* "Can I afford this vacation?"
    1.  Create a "Vacation" expense event.
    2.  Toggle it **ON**.
    3.  Does your balance stay above zero?
    4.  Toggle it **OFF** to compare.

### Zoom Tracking
Enable **Zoom Tracking** (purple toggle) to focus the timeline on a specific period.
1.  Zoom the chart into a specific month.
2.  The timeline will update to show *only* the events happening in that month.
3.  This helps you see exactly which bills are due during a low-cash period.
