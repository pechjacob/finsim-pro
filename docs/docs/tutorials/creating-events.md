# Creating Events

Events are the building blocks of your simulation. They represent money moving in or out of your accounts.

## Event Types

### Income
Adds money to your account.
*   **Examples:** Salary, Freelance work, Dividends, Gifts.

### Expense
Removes money from your account.
*   **Examples:** Rent, Groceries, Subscriptions, One-time purchases.

### Transfer
Moves money from one account to another.
*   **Examples:** Transferring to Savings, Paying off Credit Card.

## Frequency Options

When creating an event, you can choose how often it repeats:

| Frequency | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **One-time** | Happens once on a specific date. |
| **Daily** | Repeats every day. |
| **Weekly** | Repeats every week (e.g., every Friday). |
| **Bi-weekly** | Repeats every 2 weeks. |
| **Monthly** | Repeats on the same day each month. |
| **Yearly** | Repeats once a year (e.g., Birthday money). |

## Advanced: Date Ranges
You can set a **Start Date** and an **End Date** for recurring events.
*   *Example:* A car loan payment that lasts for 3 years. Set the End Date to 3 years from now, and the expense will stop automatically.
